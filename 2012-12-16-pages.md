# Publishing Markdown with Pages

Recently I've resumed tech writing.

When you start a new blog there is always a need to choose writing and publishing tools. The most common and popular tools -- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) and [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) -- are quite good. They offer a low barrier to publishing text on the Internet. Unfortunately they are lacking for technical writing.

Thankfully GitHub has built awesome tools for communicating about code. [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) has cornered the market for quickly producing good looking text and code with only a few primitives: headers, hyperlinks and pre-formatted syntax highlighted code blocks.

But for long term publishing there is still another step to then index and host polished content in HTML on the Internet. There are a few established solutions, [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), but I've found these to be complicated and confusing. I shouldn't need gems and a web server to put my already polished Markdown on my domain.

So I did what every arrogant programmer does and wrote my own publishing tool: [Pages](https://github.com/nzoschke/pages).

## Pages

Pages does the following:

* Renders .md files into HTML content with the [GitHub Markdown API](http://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/)
* Generates .html files with Markdown HTML content inserted into a website template
* Generates an index.html page linking to all .html files
* Includes the GitHub CSS to mimic Gist styling
* Manages the 'gh-pages' branch of static content

In 60 lines of Ruby code and no dependencies, Pages turns a folder of Markdown into a web site perfectly matching how a Markdown document looks on GitHub. The static files are fit to push to GitHub pages or Heroku.

This strategy encourages hacker workflow for collaboration: posts are added and edited on any browser and textarea or text editor and CLI, edits are revision controlled, work-in-progress lives in branches, and feedback comes as issues and pull requests.

I'm already 100% satisfied with Pages. If this approach interests you, give it a try and we can collaborate on feature enhancements.

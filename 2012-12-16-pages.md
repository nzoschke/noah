# Publishing Markdown with Pages

Recently I've resumed tech writing.

When you start a new blog there is always a need to choose writing and publishing tools. The most common and popular tools -- Tumblr and Wordpress -- are quite good. They offer a low barrier to publishing text on the Internet. Unfortunately they are lacking for technical writing.

Thankfully GitHub has built awesome tools for communicating about code. Gist and GitHub flavored Markdown has cornered the market for quickly producing good looking text and code with only a few primitives: headers, hyperlinks and pre-formatted syntax highlighted code blocks.

An obvious workflow has emerged among my peers: bang out a Gist with minimal Markdown syntax, and email the link around. Feedback comes in over email and Gist comments, and edits are made on the Gist.

But for long term publishing there is still another step to then index and host polished content in HTML on the Internet. There are a few established solutions, Jekyll and Octopress, but I've found these to be complicated and confusing. I shouldn't need gems and a web server to put my already polished Markdown on my domain.

So I did what every arrogant programmer does and wrote my own publishing tool: Pages.

## Pages

Pages does the following:

* Renders .md files into static .html files
* Generates a static index.html page linking to all .html files
* Uses the GitHub Markdown API to perfectly match Gist markup
* Includes the GitHub CSS to perfectly match Gist styling
* Manages a 'gh-pages' branch of static content

In 60 lines of Ruby code and no dependencies, Pages turns a folder of Markdown into a web site, perfectly matching how a Markdown document looks on GitHub, and ready for pushing to GitHub pages or Heroku.

This strategy also preserves hacker workflow for collaboration: posts can be added and edited on any browser and textarea, edits are revision controlled, work-in-progress can live in a branch, and feedback can come as issues and pull requests.

I'm already 100% satisfied with Pages. If this approach interests you, give it a try and we can collaborate on feature enhancements.
